# Files & Exceptions

## Introduction

In this assignment we are asked to research code, and create a demo for both pickling and error handling. Picking is: primarily used in serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Benefits are in that it allows a writer to serialize basically any object having to add extra code. Error handling is used to help trace and resolve errors.

## Observations

Both the course and review videos had excellent examples to draw from and build demo code:

And shown with an error written into the code:

![Pic2](https://github.com/mksoha/ITFnd100-Mod07/blob/main/Pic2.png) "Figure 2"

It certainly helps both creator and user identify where an error may be.
